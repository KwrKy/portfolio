# My Portfolio

This is portfolio serves two purposes; firstly, as a capstone project for a Coursera module, and secondly as what will become my company (company. hah) website.

That's pretty much it.

If you end up here, please feel free to give constructive criticism. Just bear in mind that this is a first project, so I still have much to learn :)
